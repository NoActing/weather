# weather
Its an weather app for iOS. The app uses location to get the current weather. Also it is powered by openweathermap.org.
Requerments: 
swift 1.2
iOS 8.3 
Xcode 6.3.2
It was my iOS final school exam.
It is not finished properly. Probably if I have some day enough time it will include:
Delete location from plist and table
Save weather data for offline use

For saving location it uses a plist
